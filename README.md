# Enterprise-Network-Design
Cisco Packet Tracer lab on VLANs, IP addressing, and router configuration for enterprise network simulation
 Overview
This project demonstrates an enterprise network design using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The lab includes VLAN configuration, IP addressing, and router interface setup to enable connectivity across devices.

Topology
1 Router (ISR 4331)
2 Multilayer Switches (3560)
1 Access Switch (2960)
 2 PCs

Objectives
1. Configure VLAN 1 on switches and assign IP addresses.
2. Configure router interface with default gateway.
3. Test connectivity between PCs and network devices.
